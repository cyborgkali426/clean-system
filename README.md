# clean-system
Total cleaning of the operating system

The user has two options for running the bash program. Either run as `root` or `sudo`.

Give the script execute permission:
```
// Before running the `bash` program, you must execute its permission first.
chmod +x clean-system.sh
```

Always run the script as `root`:
```
sudo bash clean-system.sh
``` 
or
```
sudo ./clean-system.sh
```
